title: Home Media & Network Server

## Summary
I figured there was no better way to learn "the network" other than customizing and digging into my own LAN.



## Planning the Build
So for this build, the primary goal is for it to serve as a media library that I can access from anywhere on my LAN, 
and eventually we'll port forward so I can access from anywhere in the world. 

After a few minutes of searching on Ebay, I found this Lenovo ThinkCentre m720s for $128 bucks.
These models are commercial grade, so they're build tough and meant to perform.

According to the description, it came with 1tb of HDD (Western Digital), 8GB of DDR4 RAM, and an Intel i5 8th Gen processor.
After some further research I found that although this model doesn't specifically come with a SSD, there was indeed an M.2 slot for upgrades. 

The model also comes with an optical bay, which since that's pretty useless in 2026 - I'll likely convert to additional storage so we can mirror and prevent any catastrophic data loss.

## Time for Upgrades

It only took about a week for the device to show up, and to my surprise - there wasn't a single scratch on the casing. So I cracked her open to look at the goods.

And behold, a spotless interior. I think we made out fairly well with this one, despite not knowing if she boots.
